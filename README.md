# Dolomite Margin Modules

This [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) environment is configured to use the `DolomiteMargin` instance on Arbitrum One for
testing new modules against the live deployment.

## Installation

1. Run `yarn install` to install all the dependencies.
2. Sign up on [Infura](https://infura.io/register). We recommend using Infura to allow for a reproducible Arbitrum One
   testing environment as well as efficiency due to caching.
